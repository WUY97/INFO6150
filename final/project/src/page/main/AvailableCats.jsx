I love being pet, even when I'm nervous. I just need a kind person who is willing to be patient. Outside of that, I swear my good looks will win you over when you look into my pretty face. I have gotten along with other felines over the years so I should do okay with another kitty or two with proper introductions. I may even do better with a feline friend to show me the ropes in my new home. So, are you ready to meet me? Come visit me soon.",
